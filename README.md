🌟 Go Grid Challenge: The Max Sum Quest 🌟
Embark on an exhilarating journey through a world of numbers! In this Go Grid Challenge, your mission is to navigate a square grid and unearth the path that boasts the highest sum. But remember, your adventure is bound by the laws of the grid – you may only traverse a single row or column. Speed and efficiency are your allies in this quest, as you strive for an algorithmic solution with O(n) complexity.

🧭 The Challenge
You are presented with a grid, a square of numbers, each holding secrets to untold riches. Your challenge is to devise a Go program that can uncover the highest sum possible within the confines of a single row or column.

The Grid's Law
Square Grid: The grid you will encounter is always a square, ranging in size from 2x2 to 50x50 cells.
Single Path: Your journey must be confined to a single row or column of the grid.
Optimize Your Journey: Seek efficiency in your algorithm. Aim for a time complexity of O(n).

🏁 Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Your first step on this adventure is to clone this repository.
Study the Grid: Remember, the grid is a square matrix of integers, varying in size from 2x2 to 50x50.
Implement Your Strategy: Craft your solution in a file named **[name]_solution.go**.
Test for Efficiency: Ensure your solution not only passes the test cases but also operates efficiently; as fast as possible, try to get down to O(n).

📜 Submission Guidelines
